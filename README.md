These lessons are for my course at a Gymnasium in Cologne. The course is addressed at eighth or ninth grade pupils. 
I use the [Sloeber IDE](http://eclipse.baeyens.it/) here, since it is as easy as the Arduino IDE but a lot more poweful and flexible.
All examples will also run with the Arduino IDE, just copy the program file content to a new sketch.
All lessons work on a universal breadboard layout, and can easily be adapted by changing the Breadboard.h file.

The Sloeber projects need `Arduino/preferences/Arduino/Platform and Boards/arduino/Arduino AVR Boards/1.8.1` (includes in Arduino 1.8.10) installed.
Sloeber is installed at E:\Elektro\sloeber
If `File/Inport/General/Existing Projects into Workspace` does not work, Just create a new Arduino project and choose `default cpp file`. The copy the content of the lesson to the new cpp file.
